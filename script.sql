-- Primary Keys and Relationships:

-- The Recipe table has a primary key (RecipeID).
-- The Category table has a primary key (CategoryID).
-- The Ingredient table has a primary key (IngredientID).
-- The Step table has a primary key (StepID).

-- The relationships are as follows:

-- The Recipe table references the Category table with a foreign key (CategoryID).
-- The RecipeIngredient table references both the Recipe table and the Ingredient table with foreign keys (RecipeID and IngredientID).
-- The RecipeStep table references both the Recipe table and the Step table with foreign keys (RecipeID and StepID).


--Relationships:

-- One-to-Many: A Category can have multiple Recipes.
-- Many-to-Many: A Recipe can have multiple Ingredients, and an Ingredient can be used in multiple Recipes.
-- One-to-Many: A Recipe can have multiple Steps.

--All the vegetarian recipes with potatoes:
SELECT r.Name
FROM Recipe r
JOIN RecipeIngredient ri ON r.RecipeID = ri.RecipeID
JOIN Ingredient i ON ri.IngredientID = i.IngredientID
WHERE r.CategoryID = 3 
AND i.Name = 'Potatoes';


--All the cakes that do not need baking:
SELECT r.Name
FROM Recipe r
JOIN RecipeStep rs ON r.RecipeID = rs.RecipeID
JOIN Step s ON rs.StepID = s.StepID
WHERE r.CategoryID = 2 
AND s.Description NOT LIKE '%bake%';


--All the vegan and Japanese recipes:

SELECT r.Name
FROM Recipe r
JOIN Category c ON r.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
WHERE c.Name = 'Japanese'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM RecipeIngredient ri
    JOIN Ingredient i ON ri.IngredientID = i.IngredientID
    WHERE ri.RecipeID = r.RecipeID
    AND i.Name IN ('Eggs', 'Milk')
);

--SELECT 1 in this context is just a way to structure the subquery to perform an existence check without retrieving any actual data.


--NORMALIZATION

--First Normal Form (1NF): in my database schema, all tables are  1NF since they don't contain any repeating groups, and each attribute has a single value.

--Second Normal Form (2NF):A table is in 2NF if it's in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.

-- The Recipe table is in 2NF because it has a single-column primary key (RecipeID), and the other attributes (Name, CategoryID) depend on the entire primary key.
-- The Category table is also in 2NF because it has a single-column primary key (CategoryID), and the Name attribute depends on the entire primary key.
-- The Ingredient table is in 2NF because it has a single-column primary key (IngredientID), and the Name attribute depends on the entire primary key.
-- The Step table is in 2NF because it has a single-column primary key (StepID), and the Description attribute depends on the entire primary key.

--Third Normal Form (3NF): A table is in 3NF if it's in 2NF, and there are no transitive dependencies.



-- RecipeIngredient table: RecipeID and IngredientID together make up the primary key. There's no transitive dependency issue here.
-- RecipeStep table: RecipeID and StepID together make up the primary key. There's no transitive dependency issue here.

--Based on this analysis, my original database schema was already in 2NF and 3NF. There were no changes needed to normalize the database further.

--My database schema remains the same as what I provided, and it's in a well-normalized form. Each table has a clear primary key, and there are no transitive dependencies. Therefore, no changes were required to achieve normalization.
